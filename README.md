# P,I,D Effects and Tuning
`Tuning the P component greaty helped out making sharper turns around the bends in track but had a drawback. It was oscillating heavily around the center of road. Now in order to calm the oscillating I increased the D component. Had to find the right balance of making those sharp turns and smoothness on the straightways. At some points it might have seemed the car hanged to the right tiny tiny bit but in the end I kept the I component at zero. 

I used manual tuning first finding a P to "safely" make the straight part and later D to smooth it out. When it came to the curves I had tuned P to again "safely" make the turn then D to smooth it out.
